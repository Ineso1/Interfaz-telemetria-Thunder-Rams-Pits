# Interfaz-telemetria-Thunder-Rams-Pits

This project is a telemetry system designed to monitor a prototype electric car in real-time. The system was developed to analyze and monitor the performance of the prototype vehicle during testing and development. It makes use of data received from the car's onboard computer via a serial port, which is then parsed and visualized in an intuitive and user-friendly manner. The system was first developed in electron, which allows the creation of animations of the car and real-time tracking of its position on a map. The second version of the system was built using C# and .NET, where the team can view more detailed information about the car on a dashboard. The system allows the team to view important data such as speed, angles of inclination, temperature, and geographic coordinates in real-time. This information can be used to analyze the car's performance, monitor the car status, and make adjustments to optimize the car's performance during the prototype phase. The system can be integrated into the car's onboard computer or connected to a separate monitoring device, making it a valuable tool for any team developing a prototype electric car.",
